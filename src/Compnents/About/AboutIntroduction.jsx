        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Believing in the cultural role played by 6th of October University,
          the university decided to establish a College of Applied Arts that focuses 
          on the fields of design and production technology. The college incorporates the
          latest scientific theories and advanced technologies into its curriculum.
          The university aims to collaborate with relevant entities in the field of applied arts,
          including universities, colleges, scientific institutes, production institutions, and research centers, 
          both locally and internationally. This collaboration aims to incorporate the latest advancements in design 
          and technology, ensuring that graduates of the college possess the required innovative capabilities and
          artistic skills. The university sought the expertise of professors in applied arts to develop the curriculum. 
          It also referred to curricula used in similar colleges and institutes within and outside of Egypt to guide 
          the development of appropriate curricula in light of local developments.
          The university hopes that graduates of the College of Applied Arts will contribute to the development of 
          artistic taste in utilitarian and cultural products, as well as visual communication. The college believes 
          that societal development occurs through the enhancement of daily life tools. The university places a strong 
          emphasis on the Egyptian cultural heritage and the achievements of past civilizations as a source of artistic 
          and scientific inspiration for applied arts. The university aims to contribute to the enrichment and 
          achievement of the goals of applied arts in Egypt, Arab countries, and Africa through close cooperation with 
          relevant professional associations and unions at the local, Arab, and international levels.
